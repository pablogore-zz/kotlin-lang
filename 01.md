# Local variables

Local variables can be declared in two ways: 
the val  keyword,then they are immutable (the variable cannot be reassigned). If you are coming from Java, val would be equal to variables declared with a final keyword.

Secondly, you can declare a local variable with a var keyword; then it is considered mutable and the value can be reassigned after a declaration.

```kotlin
fun immutable() {
   val bar: String = "Kotlin"
   bar = "Kotlin is awesome" // compiler error
}
```
And, when declared with var, the compiler allows a local variable to be reassigned:

```kotlin
fun mutable() {
   var bar: String = "Kotlin"
   bar = "Kotlin is awesome" 
}
```


## Functions

Functions in Kotlin are declared with the **fun** keyword. Following the keyword comes the function name, then parentheses, which contain optional function parameters. In Kotlin, return type comes at the end of the function definition, after a colon.

Here's a function in Kotlin that adds two numbers and returns the result:
```kotlin
fun add(a: Int, b: Int): Int {
    val result: Int = a + b 
    return result
}
```

If you have a function that doesn't return a result (void function), in Kotlin you can declare it as Unit returning or omit the return type completely. The following command shows this:

```kotlin
fun printToConsole(input: String): Unit {
   println(input)
}
```

No return type is also allowed and is equal to the preceding command:

```kotlin
fun printToConsole2(input: String) {
   println(input)
}
```


## Local functions
Local functions are functions declared inside a function. They are also called nested functions. 
```kotlin
fun printUserDetails(user: User) {
    fun tryPrint(str: String) {
        if (str.length > 5) {
            println(str)
        } 
       else  {
            println("I print strings with more than 5 characters")
       }
    }
    tryPrint(user.firstName)
    tryPrint(user.lastName)
    tryPrint(user.address)
}
```

The only difference between this and regular functions is the visibility. Local functions are only visible inside the function they were declared in. You cannot call a local function from a function that doesn't contain it.

## Functions everywhere

```
Top-Level-Functions  ---->  fun topLevel()=1

Member Function      ---->  class A {
                                fun member()=2
                            }

Local Function       ---->  fun other(){
                                fun local() =3 
                            }
```

***Is it possible to call a top-level function from java ?***

Yes , As a static function of the class , which name corresponds to a file name.

## @JvmName
Changes the JVM name of the class containing top-level functions

## Using @JvmName annotation

Extension.kt
```kotlin
@file:JvmName("util")
package intro

fun foo() = 0
```

JavaUsage.java
```kotlin
public class Uno {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        Util.foo();
    }
}
```

## Named and default arguments

```kotlin
fun displaySeparator(character:Char='*',size:Int=10){
    repeat(size){
        println(character)
    }
}

```

```
displaySeparator('#',5)                     //#####
displaySeparator('#')                       //##########
displaySeparator()                          //**********
displaySeparator(3,'5')                     //The code won`t compile
displaySeparator(size=3,character='5')      //The code won`t compile
```
